        <h1>Open Source Licenses: A Deep Dive into Their Meaning</h1>

        <p>There is a plethora of posts and articles about open source licenses. However, most of them are too superficial, providing only a brief overview accompanied by the <i>famous</i> table of permitted actions. I personally found them to be of little use, so this blog post was born.</p>
        <p>This post aims to provide a deeper understanding of the most common open source licenses, explaining what they mean and how they affect your project and community. We will focus on the most popular licenses, both <i>permissive</i> and <i>copyleft</i>, and we will analyze their compatibility with each other. </p>

        <h2>Why Licenses Matter</h2>

        <p>Open source software thrives because of the freedom it gives developers to use, modify, and share code. However, that freedom comes with legal frameworks called licenses.</p>
        <p>A license is a legal document that grants permission to use, modify, and share software. Itâ€™s a contract between the software creator and the user that outlines the terms and conditions of use. Licenses are essential for open source software because they protect the rights of both the creator and the user. Therefore, licenses dictate:
        <ul>
            <li>Who can use the software</li>
            <li>How the software can be modified</li>
            <li>Under what conditions the software can be redistributed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Two main types dominate the open source world: <i>permissive</i> and <i>copyleft</i> licenses. <i>Permissive</i> licenses allow developers to use, modify, and share code with few restrictions. <i>Copyleft</i> licenses require developers to share their modifications under the same license.</p>
        <p>The choice of license is crucial, not only for the presented reasons but also for the compatibility between licenses. In fact, the compatibility between licenses is essential when combining two codes into a larger work. In fact, both programs must permit that combination.</p>

        <h2>Sofware Licenses</h2>

        <h3>The Unlicense</h3>

        <p>The Unlicense is a public domain dedication that allows developers to freely use, modify, and share code, even in proprietary projects, with no restrictions. It is the most permissive license available and is not a copyleft license. This means that developers can use a project licensed under the Unlicense in any way they choose, without the obligation to share their modifications. The Unlicense is compatible with all other licenses we may encounter, making it ideal for projects that want to keep their code open source but allow proprietary software to link to it. <b>In practice</b>, the Unlicense is chosen for its simplicity and permissiveness.</p>

        <h3>Copyleft Licenses</h3>

        <p>In the following, the following phrase will be ubiquitous: <i>include the original copyright</i>. With this, I mean that the original copyright and license notice must be included in the derivative work. Concretely, for instance, this means that if the project you wish to redistribute or modify has a file called <code>LICENSE</code> or <code>COPYING</code>, you <b>must</b> retain that file (or a compatible one) in your project. If needed, you may modify it or creating a new one, ensuring that both the original copyright and license notice, as well as your own, are properly included. Usually, this lead to keep the derivative project open source too.<br><br><p>

        <p><b>GNU-GPLv3</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <b>G</b>eneral <b>P</b>ublic <b>L</b>icense version 3 is a strong popular copyleft license that allows developers to use, modify, and share code, even in proprietary projects, as long as they <b>include</b> the original copyright and license notice. The GNU-GPLv3, as a copyleft license, requires developers to share their modifications under the same license. This means that if you use a project with the GNU-GPLv3, you must share your modifications under the GNU-GPLv3. The GNU-GPLv3 is the most recent version of the GNU-GPL, and it includes provisions to protect users from (1) <b>patent litigation</b> and (2) <b>tivoization</b>. That is, the GNU-GPLv3 includes (1) an <b>express grant</b> of patent rights from contributors to users and (2) a <b>prohibition</b> on the distribution of <b>DRM-locked</b> devices. The compatibility with the GPL License is <b>not</b> guaranteed, e.g., the GNU-GPLv3 and GNU-GPLv2 are <b>not</b> compatible. Also, the GNU-GPLv3 is <b>not</b> compatible with the BSD 4-Clause License, as long as the code is distributed under the GNU-GPLv3 as we shall see later. Even when the GNU-GPLv3 is combined with the Apache License 2.0, the resulting project must be distributed under the GNU-GPLv3. <b>In practice</b>, one should choose it for its patent grant and tivoization provisions. The goal of the GNU-GPLv3 is to create a community where every improvement is shared openly, and it best suited for projects that want to ensure that their code remains open source.<br><br></p>

        <p><b>GNU-GPLv2</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <b>G</b>eneral <b>P</b>ublic <b>L</b>icense version 2 is a strong popular copyleft license that allows developers to use, modify, and share code, even in proprietary projects, as long as they <b>include</b> the original copyright and license notice. The GNU-GPLv2, as a copyleft license, requires developers to share their modifications under the same license. This means that if you use a project with the GNU-GPLv2, you must share your modifications under the GNU-GPLv2. The GNU-GPLv2 is the most popular version of the GNU-GPL, and unlike the "new" GNU-GPLv3, it does <b>not</b> include provisions to protect users from patent litigation and tivoization. Its popularity is also due to its compatibility with the MIT License, the BSD 3-Clause License, and the Apache License 2.0, with some caveats as we shall see later. <b>In practice</b>, one should choose it for its compatibility with other licenses. Exactly as the GNU-GPLv3, the goal of the GNU-GPLv2 is to create a community where every improvement is shared openly, and it best suited for projects that want to ensure that their code remains open source.<br><br></p>

        <p><b>GNU-LGPL</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <b>L</b>esser <b>G</b>eneral <b>P</b>ublic <b>L</b>icense is a weak popular copyleft license that allows developers to use, modify, and share code, even in proprietary projects, as long as they <b>include</b> the original copyright and license notice. The GNU-LGPL, as a copyleft license, requires developers to share their modifications under the same license. This means that if you use a project with the GNU-LGPL, you must share your modifications under the GNU-LGPL. The GNU-LGPL is weaker than the GNU-GPL, and it is usually used for <i>libraries</i> and <i>frameworks</i>. In fact, it allows proprietary software to link to the library while keeping modifications to the library itself open. The compatibility is allowed with all the <i>copyleft</i> and <i>permissive</i> licenses we will encounter. <b>In practice</b>, it is ideal for libraries or frameworks meant to be widely adopted without imposing the GPL on the entire project. It is also a good choice for projects that want to ensure that their code remains open source, but they want to allow proprietary software to link to it.<br><br></p>

        <p><b>MPL 2.0</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <b>M</b>ozilla <b>P</b>ublic <b>L</b>icense version 2.0 is a weak <b>file-level</b> popular copyleft license that allows developers to use, modify, and share code, even in proprietary projects, as long as they <b>include</b> the original copyright and license notice. The MPL 2.0, as a copyleft license, requires developers to share their modifications under the same license. This means that if you use a project with the MPL 2.0, you must share your modifications under the MPL 2.0. The MPL 2.0 is weaker than the GNU-GPL, and being a <b>file-level</b> copyleft license only requires that modified files are open source. This is the first license we encounter that <b>allows</b> developers to keep some files proprietary (closed source) while keeping the rest open source. The compatibility is allowed with all the <i>permissive</i> licenses but not with the GNU-GPL. <b>In practice</b>, it is ideal for projects that want to ensure that their code remains open source, but they want to keep some files proprietary.<br><br></p>

        <p><b>EPL 2.0</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <b>E</b>clipse <b>P</b>ublic <b>L</b>icense version 2.0 is a weak <b>file-level</b> popular copyleft license that allows developers to use, modify, and share code, even in proprietary projects, as long as they <b>include</b> the original copyright and license notice. The EPL 2.0, as a copyleft license, requires developers to share their modifications under the same license. This means that if you use a project with the EPL 2.0, you must share your modifications under the EPL 2.0. The EPL 2.0 is similar to the MPL 2.0, but it is more focused on <i>Java</i> projects. The compatibility is allowed with all the <i>permissive</i> licenses but not with the GNU-GPL. <b>In practice</b>, it is ideal for Java projects that want to ensure that their code remains open source, but they want to keep some files proprietary.<br><br></p>

        <h3>Permissive Licenses</h3>

        <p>In the following, the following phrase will be ubiquitous: <i>include the original copyright notice somewhere</i>. With this, unlike the copyleft licenses, I mean that the original copyright notice, which is usually the header of the file, must be included in the derivative work somewhere. Concretely, this means that if the project you wish to redistribute or modify has a file called <code>LICENSE</code> or <code>COPYING</code>, you <b>must</b> retain the original copyright notice in your project. If needed, you may modify it or creating a new one, ensuring that both the original copyright notice and your own are properly included. Of paramount importance is the fact that the permissive licenses do <b>not</b> require that the derivative work is open source and that the original license is retained.<br><br></p>

        <p><b>MIT License</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <b>M</b>a<b>s</b>sachusetts <b>I</b>nstitute of <b>T</b>echnology License is probably the most popular permissive license. It allows developers to use, modify, and share code, even in proprietary project, as long as they <b>include</b> the original copyright notice somewhere. The software is provided "as is", <b>without warranty</b> of any kind. <b>In practice</b>, the MIT License is a great choice for projects where you want maximum adoptation with minimal legal hassle, allowing both open source and proprietary use.<br><br></p>

        <p><b>BSD 4-Clause License</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <b>B</b>erkeley <b>S</b>oftware <b>D</b>istribution 4-Clause License, also known as the <i>Original BSD License</i>, is a permissive license that allows developers to use, modify, and share code, even in proprietary projects, as long as they <b>include</b> the original copyright notice somewhere. The main difference between the BSD 4-Clause License and all the other BSD licenses is the <b>advertising clause</b>. The advertising clause states that: "All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software must display the following acknowledgment: This product includes software developed by the <i>copyright holder</i>." It means, that if you use a project with the BSD 4-Clause License, you must acknowledge the original author in your advertising materials. Because of this clause, the BSD 4-Clause License is not as popular as the MIT License and it is <b>not</b> compatible with the GPL License. <b>In practice</b>, this is not ubiquitous, and one should choose it for its advertising clause.<br><br></p>

        <p><b>BSD 3-Clause License</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <b>B</b>erkeley <b>S</b>oftware <b>D</b>istribution 3-Clause License, also known as the <i>New BSD License</i>, is a permissive license that allows developers to use, modify, and share code, even in proprietary projects, as long as they <b>include</b> the original copyright notice somewhere. The BSD 3-Clause License, unlike the BSD 4-Clause License, does <b>not</b> have the advertising clause. This makes the BSD 3-Clause License more popular than the BSD 4-Clause License and compatible with the GPL License. The <b>non-endorsement</b> clause is kept, as in the BSD 4-Clause License, and it states that: "Neither the name of the <i>copyright holder</i> nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission." <b>In practice</b>, one should choose it for its non-endorsement clause and for its compatibility with the GPL License.<br><br></p>

        <p><b>BSD 2-Clause License</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <b>B</b>erkeley <b>S</b>oftware <b>D</b>istribution 2-Clause License, also known as the <i>FreeBSD License</i>, is a permissive license that allows developers to use, modify, and share code, even in proprietary projects, as long as they <b>include</b> the original copyright and license notice. The BSD 2-Clause License, unlike the other BSD licenses, does <b>not</b> have the advertising clause and the non-endorsement clause. This makes the BSD 2-Clause License the most popular BSD license and compatible with the GPL License. <b>In practice</b>, it is very similar to the MIT License, and one should choose it over the MIT License for its more verbosity that explicitly reiterates the same condition used for source code distribution for binary distribution.<br><br></p>

        <p><b>Apache License 2.0</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Apache License 2.0 is a permissive license that allows developers to use, modify, and share code, even in proprietary projects, as long as they <b>include</b> the original copyright notice somewhere. The Apache License 2.0 is similar to the MIT License, but it includes an <b>express grant</b> of patent rights from contributors to users. This means that if you use a project with the Apache License 2.0, you are granted a license to any patents that the contributors hold that cover the code. The Apache License 2.0 introduces this aspecific clause to protect users from patent litigation. The compatibility with the GPL License is <b>not</b> guaranteed, i.e., the Apache License 2.0 can be included in a GPL project as long as the resulting project is distributed under the GPL License, the vice versa is <b>not</b> true. <b>In practice</b>, one should choose it over the MIT License for its patent grant by keeping in mind the compatibility issues with the GPL License.<br><br></p>

        <p><b>ISC License</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <b>I</b>nternet <b>S</b>ystems <b>C</b>onsortium License is a permissive license that allows developers to use, modify, and share code, even in proprietary projects, as long as they <b>include</b> the original copyright notice somewhere. The ISC License is a simplified version of the MIT License and the FreeBSD License, with the same permissions and conditions, but with a more concise and readable text. <b>In practice</b>, one should choose it over the other two licenses for its simplicity and readability.<br><br></p>


        <h2>Creative Commons Licenses</h2>

        <p> The first question that comes to mind is: <i>why are we talking about Creative Commons Licenses in a post about software licenses?</i> The answer is simple: <i>because they are licenses</i>. The Creative Commons Licenses are a set of licenses that allow creators to share their work with the public under specific conditions. They are widely used for non-software projects, such as music, images, text, and datasets. The Creative Commons Licenses are not designed for software, but they can be used for it.</p>

        <p><b>CC0</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>C</b>reative <b>C</b>ommons <b>0</b> is a public domain dedication that allows developers to freely use, modify, and share code, even in proprietary projects, with no restrictions. It is the most <i>permissive</i> license available and is not a copyleft license. This means that developers can use a project licensed under the CC0 License in any way they choose, without the obligation to share their modifications. <b>In practice</b>, the CC0 License is chosen for its simplicity and permissiveness.<br><br></p>

        <p><b>CC-BY</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>C</b>reative <b>C</b>ommons <b>B</b>Y <b>A</b>ttribution is a license that allows to distibute, remix, adapt, and build upon the work, even for commercial purposes, as long as the original author is credited. <b>In practice</b>, the CC-BY License is chosen for its no additional restrictions besides the attribution requirement.<br><br></p>

        <p><b>CC-BY-SA</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>C</b>reative <b>C</b>ommons <b>B</b>Y <b>S</b>hare <b>A</b>like is a license that allows to distibute, remix, adapt, and build upon the work, even for commercial purposes, as long as the original author is credited and the new work is licensed under the same terms. Basically, a <i>copyleft</i> license. <b>In practice</b>, the CC-BY-SA License is chosen for its no additional restrictions besides the attribution and share alike requirements.<br><br></p>

        <p><b>CC-BY-NC</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>C</b>reative <b>C</b>ommons <b>B</b>Y <b>N</b>on <b>C</b>ommercial is a license that allows to distibute, remix, adapt, and build upon the work, as long as the original author is credited and the new work cannot be used for commercial purposes. <b>In practice</b>, the CC-BY-NC License is chosen for its no additional restrictions besides the attribution and non commercial requirements.<br><br></p>
